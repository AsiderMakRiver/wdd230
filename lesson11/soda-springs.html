        <h3>Welcome to Soda Springs!</h3>
        <p>
          The city has been the county seat of Caribou County since the county was organized in 1919. In the 1860s,
          Soda Springs served as the seat of Oneida County.
          <br />
          <br />
          The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are located in and around
          the city. The springs were well known to Native Americans and were a famous landmark along the Oregon
          Trail in the middle 19th century. Today the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs
          Geyser, which was unleashed in 1934 when "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool"
          bathing attraction. Instead they drilled into a chamber of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas and cold
          water and the geyser was released. After running for weeks, and flooding the downtown area, it was capped
          and manually released when requested as a tourist attraction. Now it is let loose every hour on the hour
          by a timed release valve. Its height and volume have not decreased after many years. There are viewing
          platforms at either end of the travertine mound where the geyser erupts. Interpretive signs are located
          on the platforms explaining this phenomenon.
