        <h3>Welcome to Fish Haven!</h3>
        <p>
          The first settlement at Fish Haven was made in 1864. A post office called Fish Haven was established in
          1867, and remained in operation until 1962. The community was so named because nearby Bear Lake is a
          favorite fishing spot.
          <br />
          <br />
          Also Fish Haven is an unincorporated community along the shores of Bear Lake. Bear Lake is a natural
          freshwater lake on the Idahoâ€“Utah border in the Western United States. About 109 square miles (280 km2)
          in size, it is split about equally between the two states; its Utah portion comprises the second-largest
          natural freshwater lake in Utah, after Utah Lake. The lake has been called the "Caribbean of the Rockies"
          for its unique turquoise-blue color, which is due to the refraction of calcium carbonate (limestone)
          deposits suspended in the lake. Its water properties have led to the evolution of several unique species
          of fauna that occur only within the lake. Bear Lake is over 250,000 years old. It was formed by fault
          subsidence that continues today, slowly deepening the lake along the eastern side. In 1911 the majority
          of the flow of the Bear River was diverted into Bear Lake via Mud Lake and a canal from Stewart Dam,
          ending 11,000 years of separation between the lake and that river system.
